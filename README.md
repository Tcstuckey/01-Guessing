# 01-Guessing 
This is my first project in C220; a number guessing game, written in python. The pupose of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures. 

The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The player then has as many oppotunities as needed to refine the guess. The game reports the total number of tries taken.
